Takeaway Challenge
==================

About
-----
This is the Week 2 Makers Academy Challenge, built in one weekend, using Ruby. The task was to create a program which satisfies the following user stories

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
```
```
As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
```
```
As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order
```
```
As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Approach
-----
- I worked through the above user sotries, one at a time, using TDD to drive my code
- I made sure to use doubles and stubs where appropriate to create isolated unit tests 
- I aimed to achieve full test coverage
- To send the confirmation texts, I integrated the Twilio API into my program using the twilio-ruby gem
- To avoid disclosing my personal information, I created a file with environmental variables which I added to .gitignore
- I required the dotenv gem to access thses variables
- After satisfying the above user stories, I refactored my code, ensuring necessary methods were made private, and trying to abide by the Single Responsibility Principle for methods
